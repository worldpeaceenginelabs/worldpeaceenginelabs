<h2 align="center">🌍 The world’s first truly decentralized ecosystem — a new operating system for Earth.</h2>

<p align="center"><b>Cloud Atlas is a decentralized civic operating system with spatial interface,  redefining how humans organize, collaborate, and innovate.</b></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Infrastructureless. Unstoppable.<br>
Run by the people, for the people.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Not just a platform.<br>
Not just an app.</strong></p>

<h3 align="center">A new spatial interface merging the digital and physical worlds.</h3>

<p align="center" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
One shared ecosystem where civic action, learning, entertainment, and real-world impact converge on a fully decentralized infrastructure—serving as both the foundation and seamless part of the experience.
</p>

<p align="center" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
Here, apps, games, knowledge, and civic tools live directly on a 3D globe that replaces traditional feeds, menus, and app stores with a geography-driven discovery experience, enabling users to zoom in, act locally, and think globally.
</p>

<p align="center" style="max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;">
Discover by geography, not keywords. Instantly create and collaborate through prompt-to-app, prompt-to-game, prompt-to-idea, prompt-to-solution workflows, brainstormings, and collective missions—all within one intuitive interface and without any infrastructure costs.

## CORE COMPONENTS

### 🌍 Decentralized Swarm Governance — It’s like Spontacts and FixMyStreet had a baby with Kickstarter and Change.org
It’s government by doing, not by voting. Brainstorm, petition, crowdfund, and organize action through gamified civic modules. Get paid for the issues you love, and make friends on the way. (payments coming directly from the crowdfunding pool raised for each mission)

### 🎥 Mission TV — Like Twitch — but for real-world impact
Users stream their mission progress, earn tips, and inspire others to act. It’s social change as entertainment, with viewers funding and joining in, live. Fueling social change through engaging video content. With Mission TV, we're creating a new kind of influencer: the good human — someone striving to become the best version of themselves. Our platform celebrates those who gain recognition by doing good, inspiring others to do the same and rise to their highest potential.

### 📚 Virtual Encyclopedia
Over 6 Million Wikipedia articles transformed into immersive, animated 3D objects and scenes — geolocated on a global map and powered by BitTorrent.
- The more people explore, the smarter and faster it gets.
- Truth-checking happens by exploration: users naturally flag anomalies while navigating the world.

### 🎮 App/Game/Openworld Layer — Like Layer.ai, Google Maps, and a 3D Wikipedia had a baby.
Anyone  can build and remix apps, games, and experiences with drag-and-drop tools, code, or AI prompts - Plug into our decentralized backend or bring your own.
Leverage the 6 million Wikipedia 3D objects to build real-world, location-based apps, games and experiences. e.g., say “New York, Cyberpunk style, First Person Shooter,” and instantly generate a monetizable, real-world game in seconds.
“If you can describe it, you can code it.” Walt Disney(z)
